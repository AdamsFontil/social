# Tweeter Clone

Hey there, welcome to Tweeter Clone – a project I'm really proud of. I built this without following any YouTube tutorials, just wanted to see what I can do. I used Shadcnui for its awesome interface creation and Tailwind CSS for styling. On the backend, React Query simplified the process of working with and calling routes. However, the real powerhouse behind this project is Supabase, serving as its backbone. From data management to storage, Supabase handled the heavy lifting, making the creation of Tweeter a more achievable feat.

## Features

## A Personal Note

This project is a testament to the skills I picked up during my break from school. I'll be heading back soon, so this is probably my last project for a while, as I'm not majoring in Computer Science. It's been a blast working on this Twitter Clone. Future updates may come if I find the time. Thanks for checking my project! Please feel free to explore the site and let me know if you liked it.
